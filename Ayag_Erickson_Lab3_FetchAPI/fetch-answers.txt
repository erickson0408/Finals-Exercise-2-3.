1. What are the main differences between XMLHttpRequest and Fetch API?
- Fetch API uses Promises, while XMLHttpRequest uses callbacks.
- Fetch code is simpler and cleaner.
- Fetch supports modern async/await syntax.

2. Why is the Fetch API considered more modern and readable?
- It uses Promises, which make code easier to read and handle errors better.
- It avoids callback nesting and works well with async/await.

3. What is the purpose of the .then() and .catch() methods in Fetch?
- .then() handles the response after the request is successful.
- .catch() catches and handles any errors during the request.

4. What happens when you send a POST request to the placeholder API?
- The API simulates creating a new post and returns a fake post ID (usually 101).
- No real data is saved because it’s a testing API.
